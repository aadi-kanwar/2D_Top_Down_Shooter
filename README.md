### Made with Unity

This project a simple 2D top-down shooter in Unity, aimed at introducing essential game development concepts. The game features player input using Unityâ€™s new input system, enabling precise and responsive controls. 

It utilizes Unity's physics system for smooth movement of game objects, enhancing the gameplay experience. 

The game also covers 2D animation, helping developers create visually appealing and fluid character motions.  
Additionally, the game integrates enemy AI, with enemies actively pursuing or attacking the player, and an enemy spawning system that continuously generates challenges. Collectables such as health boosts and power-ups add depth to the gameplay. A health system is implemented to manage player health, while score tracking allows players to compete for high scores.


The projec includes interactive game menus for a polished finish. Health collectables ensure extended gameplay, offering a balance between challenge and reward. By the end of the series, viewers will have created a complete 2D game, providing a solid foundation for future game development projects, portfolio work, or simply gaining hands-on experience in Unity.
